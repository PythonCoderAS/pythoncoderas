<h2 align="center">Welcome to PythonCoderAS's Profile!</h2>
Hello, and thank you for checking me out. I am a high schooler who loves to program, and have been doing so for over 4 years.

I mostly code in **Python**, and it's still my most favorite language. However, I have taken an interest in the **JavaScript/TypeScript** programming languages, and can also write intermediate-level **Java** code. I can also write intermediate-level **SQL** queries and **Bash/Shell Scripts**.

I'm always open to suggestions. If you see something in any of my projects that you would like to correct, even something as minor as a spelling mistake, feel free to make a PR to any of my repositories. I will almost certainly merge it in!
